# Test Suite Documentation

This directory contains a comprehensive test suite for the Local Orchestrator Tray project, designed to ensure code quality, reliability, and performance through comprehensive testing strategies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Test Architecture Philosophy

This test suite follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles and is structured to drive the refactoring of complex methods identified in the code review. The tests are designed to:

1. **Drive Implementation** - Tests are written first to define expected behavior
2. **Prevent Regressions** - Comprehensive coverage prevents breaking changes
3. **Document Behavior** - Tests serve as living documentation
4. **Enable Refactoring** - Safe refactoring through comprehensive test coverage
5. **Ensure Quality** - Multiple testing strategies ensure robust code

### Naming Conventions
- **Test Files**: `test_<feature_area>_<purpose>.py`
- **Test Classes**: `Test<FeatureArea><Aspect>`
- **Test Methods**: `test_<should_do_what>_<when_condition>`

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual method/function testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **Property Tests**: Random input boundary testing
- **Concurrent Tests**: Thread safety and race condition testing
- **Security Tests**: Security vulnerability testing
- **Performance Tests**: Performance characteristic testing

## ðŸ”§ Running Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Running the tests
