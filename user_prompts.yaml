    Let's start with the "tdd-test-writer" to fix its mess, followed by the "tdd-implementer".

    I just run `pytest` and it fails. Please, fix it!

    I want you to fix the tests, not to disable them.

    Please, restart the previous todo as there was an error setting up the memory-troubleshooter MCP. It's fixed now. Restart the task: Start generic sub-agent to troubleshoot test failures - run tests, create todos for each failure, and analyze them one-by-one using root-cause-detective

    There is no such command: `claude agent root-cause-detective "Analy...`. You should just launch `claude "<prompt>`, and put the "use the root-cause-detective agent" as part of the prompt. When calling `claude` in Bash, I recommend using the `-p --output-format stream-json` flags too.

    1. Run the tests
    2. Using the TodoWrite tool, create a todo for every single failure separately to analyse the failure 1-by-1 using the root-cause-detective agent.
    3. Process the first unresolved todo item. Note that the agent is only analysing the failure and related codebase. It is not allowed to resolve the failure!
    4. Iterate from (3)
